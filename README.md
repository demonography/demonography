# Hello! :fox_face:

I'm Ris. I'm a visual communicator who likes to draw, design, animate, code, and eat. Most of the time, you'll likely find me doing a combination of the above.

I'm currently a full time lead product/user experience designer and design manager. I am also a full time cat parent to a small little gremlin cat.
